## Define in your own word: (a) intelligence, (b) artificial intelligence, (c) agent.

a) `Intelligence` the ability to adapt or even change the environment ,or to think abstractly.

b) `Artificial intelligence` is a kind of intelligence created by human, which exists on non-human machines.

c) An `agent` is a entity which is empowered to act on behalf of an entity to interact with the world.

## There are well-known classes of problem that are intractably difficult for computers, and other classes that are provably undecidable. Does this mean that AI is impossible?

No. It only means that current AI systems should avoid trying to solve too thorny problems. Generally, it means that they can only try to behave well. We should category all problems into several groups: a)those which can be solved by AI much better than humans: in these circumstances, there is no doubt that we could let AIs handle them; b) those which are much suitable for humans rather than current AIs: there is still potentials for better AI to be developed by learning from how our brains work, like auto driving technologies; c)problems that neither human and current AIs can solve: people should may pay more efforts in developing better AIs, as our body structures are even mode difficult to be modified. Consequently, AIs are possible, and they have proved themselves by gaining many achievements in many specific fields like smart CCTV system and data analysis. We should be more confident in the future of AI.

## Define in your own words the following terms: agent function, agent program, rationality.

a) `agent function`: functions that map sense perceptual sequence to actions;

b) `agent program`: programs to implement agent functions.

c) `rationality`: a kind of attribute in agents, which make agents to perform best in given perceptual sequences.
